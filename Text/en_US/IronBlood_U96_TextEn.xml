The wolves lurking in the depths of the sea are terrifying, but you are one of the reasons why they are so terrifying, and many ships have been buried because of you. Go forth again, U-96, and your enemies will forever remember the fear that comes from the smile of the Smiling Sawfish.</Text>

			<Text>As part of a wolf pack that strikes from the bottom of the sea, U-96 is naturally the master of the ocean, where her units receive a powerful ability bonus. As the leader of the Iron Blood, U-96 is well able to utilize the large and powerful armies that are created as the city grows - waging war. Whether it's killing units or looting areas, the U-96 can reap huge benefits. Don't worry about enemy navies! The VIIC submarines will devour them like wolves. Utilizing the Ruhr and the Krupp to bring powerful units and great production capacity, the U-96 will be invincible in conquering victories.</Text>

			<Text>U-96 was a Type VIIC submarine built by the German Navy during World War II. Construction began on September 16, 1939 at Ditch 601 of the Friedrich Krupp Germania shipyard in Kiel Harbor at the outbreak of the war, and she was launched on August 1, 1940.U-96 was officially commissioned on September 14, 1940, and was assigned to Submarine Squadron 7, which was deployed to St. Nazaire, France, to begin its mission.</Text>

			<Text>The emblem of the U-96 was very famous: like the U-47's emblem "Bull", which became the emblem of the 7th Submarine Squadron, the U-96's emblem "Smiling Saw Rays" became the emblem of the 9th Submarine Squadron, which was formed in March 1942, and the U-96's emblem "Saw Skate" became the emblem of the 9th Submarine Squadron.</Text>

			<Text>She was one of the true legends that stood out among the hundreds of German U-boats of World War II: she flew 11 cruises, participated in 11 wolf packs, cooperated with numerous U-boats, sank 27 ships totaling 181,206 tons, wounded 4 ships totaling 33,043 tons, and additionally hit and wounded the 8,888-ton British ship Kars causing it to be a total loss and return to port as a direct scrap.</Text>

			<Text>It should be noted that the first captain of the U-96 was Heinrich Lehmann-Wilhelmbrock, the 6th largest German U-boat captain in terms of gross tonnage sunk during World War II. Much of Heinrich Lehmann's legend is based on the U-96 - especially the third cruise of the U-96 in February 1941, which was a major success at the end of the "first good times". With U-69, U-73, U-95 and U-107, the U-96 sank nine freighters and one frigate of the OB-288 group, three of which were credited to the U-96. Heinrich Lehmann was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his efforts and stepped down as captain of U-96 in April.</Text>

			<Text>From August 1941, the U-96 began its 6th cruise and participated in the "Wolf Pack", but the results began to become difficult - the 7th cruise attempted to break through the Strait of Gibraltar but was detected and failed, and the 10th cruise, which joined the Wolf Pack, codenamed "Forward", was a rare achievement at the end of the U-96's service. The inclusion of the Wolfpack, codenamed "Forward", on the 10th cruise was a rare achievement at the end of the U-96's service. By February 1943, U-96 had completed her 11th cruise and arrived at Koenigsberg, where she became a training ship; she was decommissioned at Wilhelmshaven in February 1945, where she was sunk by a U.S. air attack on March 30 of the same year. Two months after her sinking, the German submarine force carried out the "Rainbow Directive" and the U-boats sank en masse.</Text>

			<Text>The VIIC was the mainstay of the German U-boat force, with a total of 568 submarines in service from 1940 to 1945. The first VIIC submarine was U-69, commissioned in 1940, which had a range of only 8,500 nautical miles, less than the 11,000 nautical mile range of the Type IX, which severely limited its cruising time in the farther Western and South Atlantic. The VIIC entered service near the end of the German submarine war "Belle Époque" or "First Good Time", and remained the most numerous type of submarine in service during the overwhelming Allied anti-submarine victories of late 1943 and 1944.</Text>

			<Text>The Type VIIC differed from the Type VIIB only by the addition of active sonar and some minor mechanical improvements that increased its length by 2 feet and its weight by 8 tons, while its speed and cruising range were essentially the same. They had the same torpedo tube arrangement as their Type VIIB predecessors except for U-72, U-78, U-80, U-554, and U-555 (which had only two forward torpedo tubes), and U-203, U-331, U-351, U-401, U-431, and U-651 (which had no rearward torpedo tubes).</Text>

			<Text>The most famous VIIC submarine would be the U-96, which was the basis for Buchheim's 1973 best-selling novel "From the Bottom of the Sea", based on the author's personal experience as a war correspondent on one of the U-96's cruises. The novel was remade by German director Wolfgang Petersen in 1981 as the movie of the same name, From the Bottom of the Sea, which won many awards and accolades, and made the U-96 known to the world.</Text>
