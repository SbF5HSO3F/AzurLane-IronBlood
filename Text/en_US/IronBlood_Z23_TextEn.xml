This means that Z23 can gain technological and municipal advantages by flexing the order in which she researches Technologies and Civics, and she can advance her current Technologies or Civics by triggering [ICON_TECHBOOSTED] Eureka or [ICON_CIVICBOOSTED] Inspiration from the back of the line. Of course, Z23 also has an excellent army: they have higher [ICON_MOVEMENT] mobility and gain [ICON_Strength] combat bonuses when in enemy territory. Don't worry even if they're heavily outnumbered, turning on a military unit's Destruction Mode in enemy District will restore the unit's life and briefly increase its [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength, which is enough to take down any enemy in one fell swoop.</Text>

			<Text>The Z23 was the first ship of the Nazi German Navy's Z-wing 1936A class, which consisted of 15 ships including the 1936A and was also known as the Narvik class. The biggest improvement of the Z23 was the larger caliber of the main gun, from 127mm to 150mm. Other than that, there was not much change compared to the Z-drive up to 1936. Starting with the Z23, the Z-drive was no longer named after the German Navy soldiers who died in WWI, but was simply named after the type.</Text>

			<Text>Since the completion of the design and construction of the Type 1936 destroyer, the next stage of the German design work in two directions: 1, for the Baltic Sea and the North Sea of small destroyers, standard displacement of 1,500 tons, speed of 40 knots, and the British destroyer is similar to; 2, for the Atlantic Ocean, a large ocean-going destroyer, which is the Type 1937 destroyer, whose standard displacement is more than 3,700 tons, and the fully loaded Its standard displacement was more than 3,700 tons, and its full load displacement was close to 5,000 tons, which was a kind of mini cruiser. However, the development of the Type 1937 encountered difficulties and was criticized for its protection, firepower, speed and range, which were not commensurate with its large tonnage. In April 1938, the development of the Type 1937 destroyer was halted, and the designers were asked to develop a general-purpose fleet destroyer on the basis of the successful Type 1936 destroyer on a similar line of thought, which became the Type 1936A destroyer. This became the Type 1936A destroyer.</Text>

			<Text>The most distinctive feature of this class of destroyers was the use of a light cruiser class 150mm caliber main gun, the Tbts KC/36 or Tbts KC/36T, 48x. The main reason for this was to gain an advantage over the French super destroyers with 138.6mm caliber guns. The main reason for this was the desire to gain an advantage over the French super-destroyers, which were armed with 138.6mm guns. 5 150mm guns were arranged in the form of 1 twin turret + 3 single mounted turrets, although the development of the twin turrets had not yet been completed, and delays in their production meant that they could only be fitted with single mounted turrets where the twin turrets would have been, when they were completed. After 1942, with the exception of Z26 and Z30, the ships were fitted with twin turrets one at a time. One of them, Z-28, was designed as a commander's destroyer, with a deckhouse aft for staff officers, and four 150mm guns mounted on four single-mounted turrets, in a two forward and two aft configuration.</Text>

			<Text>Between November 1938 and April 1940, eight Type 1936A destroyers (Z23-Z30) were built, and from September 1940, the Type 1936A (Mob), meaning "Mobilmachung" (mobilized), or wartime mobilized destroyer, was built. The Mob underwent some minor changes, mainly to the internal layout, some improvements to the power plant, a raised bow turret collar, and a larger chimney cap. 12 Mob ships were planned, Z31-Z42, but 7 were completed (Z31-Z34, Z37-Z39), Z35 and Z36 were moved to 1936B (Mob), Z40-Z42 were moved to 1938A, and Z40-Z42 were moved to 1938B (Mob).

			<Text>The 150mm main gun greatly enhanced the firepower of this class, and further increased the ship's size and displacement to over 3,500 tons full load, but there were still problems with seakeeping and stability, with the ship's bow being heavily surfed, and the ship swaying heavily in the wind and waves. Later designs reverted to the 128mm main gun of the former type, the 1936B (Mob). The development of a new type of destroyer with a new 128mm anti-aircraft gun, the Type 1936C, was also started.</Text>
